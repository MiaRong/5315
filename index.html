      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer.  - https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker</p>
      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTP cache. Nginx can be deployed to serve dynamic HTTP content on the network using FastCGI, SCGI handlers for scripts, WSGI application servers or Phusion Passenger modules, and it can serve as a software load balancer. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx </p>
      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine </p>
